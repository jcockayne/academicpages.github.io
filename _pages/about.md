I am a final year PhD student at the University of Warwick, supervised by Mark Girolami. I am constructing methods for numerical solution of partial differential equations which return a probability measure describing uncertainty due to discretisation error. In particular I am interested in how this can be applied to incorporate error in the forward model into posterior distributions in Bayesian inverse problems.
